    Endpoint to send an email via an SMTP service.

    This endpoint facilitates sending an email using the configured SMTP service. It performs
    the operation in a separate thread using `run_in_threadpool`, which is suitable for blocking I/O
    operations, such as sending emails. By offloading the sending process to a thread pool, it prevents
    the asynchronous event loop from being blocked, ensuring that other tasks in the application
    remain responsive.

    Args:
        request (Request): The incoming HTTP request, providing context such as the base URL.
        smtp (SMTPEmailService): The SMTP email service dependency injected to send emails.
        sender (EmailStr): The sender's email address.
        recipients (list[EmailStr]): A list of recipient email addresses.
        subject (str): The subject line of the email.
        body_text (str, optional): The plain-text body of the email. Defaults to an empty string.

    Returns:
        dict: A JSON object indicating success with a message, e.g., {"message": "Email sent"}.

    Logs:
        Logs relevant email metadata: request base URL, sender, recipients, and subject.

    Why `run_in_threadpool`:
        Sending an email often involves interacting with external SMTP servers, which can be
        a slow, blocking operation. Using `run_in_threadpool` is beneficial because:
        1. Blocking I/O operations like SMTP requests do not interrupt the main event loop,
           preventing other tasks (e.g., handling HTTP requests) from slowing down.
        2. The email-sending logic is offloaded to a separate, managed thread pool, improving
           application performance and scalability.
